## 🧪 **Testing Recommendations**

### **Backend Tests**
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health

# Test API endpoints
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/auth/register
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/auth/login
```

### **Frontend Tests**
```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Test in Expo Go
# - Scan QR code
# - Test login/signup
# - Test navigation
# - Test API connectivity
```

## 🔍 **Monitoring & Debugging**

### **Railway Logs**
```bash
railway logs
```

### **Expo Logs**
