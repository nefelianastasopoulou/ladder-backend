# Railway Deployment Issues - Solutions

## Issues Identified and Solutions

### 1. Environment Variables Setup
Your `.env` file contains sensitive data that needs to be configured in Railway's dashboard.

**Required Environment Variables for Railway:**
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
JWT_SECRET=5e90f6ba6f528941a7d75a130d820b41b5b473fb622b5fa9361666ba02b8f814d544c9bfafa8c5b5a858c24b368d4de8316bcbcf76620e82419d410f9c8ca34f
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
JWT_ISSUER=ladder-backend
JWT_AUDIENCE=ladder-app
EMAIL_USER=contact@ladderyouth.com
EMAIL_PASS=awejkenbsyvwupei
ADMIN_EMAIL=nefelianastasopoulou12@gmail.com
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=LadderAdmino3qbiaajanj!2024
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-app.railway.app,https://yourdomain.com
TRUST_PROXY=true
DATABASE_SSL=false
DATABASE_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false
```

### 2. Database Configuration
Railway automatically provides `DATABASE_URL` - make sure it's connected to your PostgreSQL service.

### 3. CORS Configuration
Update your allowed origins to include your Railway app URL.

### 4. Security Improvements
- Remove sensitive data from `.env` file
- Use Railway's environment variables instead
- Enable trust proxy for Railway

## Steps to Fix Deployment:

1. **Set Environment Variables in Railway Dashboard:**
   - Go to your Railway project
   - Navigate to Variables tab
   - Add all the environment variables listed above

2. **Update CORS Origins:**
   - Replace `https://your-app.railway.app` with your actual Railway app URL
   - Add any other domains you need

3. **Database Connection:**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL service is connected
   - Railway will automatically set `DATABASE_URL`

4. **Deploy:**
   - Push your changes to trigger a new deployment
   - Monitor the deployment logs for any errors

## Common Railway Issues and Solutions:

### Issue: "Cannot find module" errors
**Solution:** Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json` and not in `devDependencies` for production.

### Issue: Port binding errors
**Solution:** Your server correctly uses `process.env.PORT` - this should work with Railway.

### Issue: Database connection failures
**Solution:** Check that `DATABASE_URL` is set and PostgreSQL service is running.

### Issue: Environment validation failures
**Solution:** Ensure all required environment variables are set in Railway dashboard.

## Next Steps:
1. Set the environment variables in Railway
2. Update CORS origins with your actual domain
3. Redeploy your application
4. Check deployment logs for any remaining issues
